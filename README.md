# Spike RX-Java
A small study to test RX-Java in order to conceive a booking process (book, payment, compta, insurance ...).
I use a mutable object as observed by RX-Java (I know ...) to store the state of the booking process.
For testing purpose I use a mocked code to simulate the call of API (with Api Class).
